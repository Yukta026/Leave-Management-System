# ðŸŒŸ Leave Management App (Built with ABAP RAP & Fiori)

This project demonstrates how a **Leave Management System** can be built using the **ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)** in the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) trial environment.  

Employees can **submit leave requests**, and managers can **approve or reject** them directly through a modern **Fiori app**.  
It showcases how backend business logic, database handling, and user interface can all come together in SAPâ€™s cloud environment.

## ðŸ§© How It Works (Simplified)

1. **Data Model** â€“ A table (`ZTABLE_NEW`) stores leave requests (employee, leave type, dates, status).  
2. **Business Logic** â€“ RAP behavior implementation controls what happens when a leave is **approved** or **rejected**.  
3. **Fiori Interface** â€“ The OData service is automatically consumed by a Fiori Elements app, giving managers a clean UI to act on requests.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Submit & Manage Requests** â€“ Employees can request different types of leave (vacation, sick leave, etc.).  
- **Approve / Reject Actions** â€“ Managers act on requests with a single click.  
- **Automated UI Generation** â€“ Fiori Elements generates a responsive web app directly from the service definition.  
- **Realistic Workflow** â€“ Mimics the type of leave management process used in enterprises.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project Matters

- Shows practical use of **SAPâ€™s RAP framework**, which is the modern way of developing apps in ABAP.  
- Demonstrates **end-to-end skills**: data modeling, backend logic, and frontend UI.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Designing a **RAP Business Object** and handling **instance-level authorization**.  
- Implementing **custom actions** like Approve/Reject in ABAP.  
- Debugging RAP short dumps and resolving missing handler issues.  
- Connecting business logic with a **Fiori app** to provide a user-friendly interface.
